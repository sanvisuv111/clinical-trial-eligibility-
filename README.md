# clinical-trial-eligibility-

Project Description
Clinical Trial Eligibility Engine is an intelligent Python application that automates patient identification for clinical trials. Here's what it does:

The Problem It Solves:
Clinical trial recruitment is slow and tedious—staff manually reviews hundreds of patient charts to find eligible candidates
This is error-prone and time-consuming

The Solution:
Automatically evaluates patient health records against trial requirements to identify eligible candidates in seconds instead of hours.

Core Capabilities:
-Parses Patient Records 

– Reads electronic health records (EHR) from standardized formats

-Evaluates Eligibility – Automatically checks complex medical criteria: Age requirements, Medical conditions (diabetes, heart disease, etc.), Current medications, Lab values, Allergies 

-Filters & Matches – Rapidly identifies which patients qualify for which trials

-Generates Reports – Provides detailed eligibility assessments explaining decisions


Real Impact:
-Speeds up clinical trial recruitment

-Improves accuracy of patient matching

-Reduces manual work for clinical staff

-Helps get life-saving treatments to patients faster

Technical Highlights:
-Built with pure Python (no external dependencies)

-4 well-organized modules with clean architecture

-100% test coverage (20 passing tests)

-Production-ready with error handling

-Includes sample patient data and predefined trial template
